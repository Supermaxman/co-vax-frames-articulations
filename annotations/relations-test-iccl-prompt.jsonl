{"role": "user", "content": "Frames of communication select particular aspects of an issue and make them salient in communicating a message.\nFor example, when discussing the confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, selecting the aspects concerning the development of the vaccine may convey the message that the vaccine is safe because:\n(a) scientists have worked for decades on coronavirus vaccines, and\n(b) the vaccine has been tested and tracked\nFrames of communication are ubiquitous in social media discourse and can impact how people understand issues and, more importantly, how they form their opinions.\nSocial science stipulates that discourse almost inescapably involves framing \u2013 a strategy of highlighting certain issues to promote a certain interpretation or attitude.\nFor example, when considering one of the important factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy, namely vaccine confidence, conflicting perspectives on this issue compete to attract attention on social media and to influence opinions and attitudes towards vaccination.\nIt has been argued that \"to frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described.\"\nYou will be tasked with identifying relationships between vaccine hesitancy framings.\nYou should discuss your reasoning first, and then provide a final decision.\nEach framing provided may or may not be involved in a single relationship with one framing from a provided set of similar framings.\nWe will consider three possible relationships:\n1. Paraphrases(X,Y): X and Y say essentially the same exact thing, with different words or phrasing. If one person agreed with X, they would agree with Y, and vice versa.\nFrames should share the same cause and the same problem to be considered paraphrases.\n2. Specializes(X,Y): X is a more specific or detailed framing of Y. Notice the order of X and Y is important for this relationship, as X is more specific and Y is more general.\nFrames should share the same problem, but have more specific or general causes to be considered specializes.\n3. Contradicts(X,Y): X and Y contradict each other, such that they frame the same exact issue from opposing perspectives. If one person agreed with X, they would disagree with Y, and vice versa.\nBe extremely careful with the contradicts relationship, as we do not want two frames to contradict simply because they say the vaccine is safe vs unsafe, the frames need to have the same cause to contradict, such as safe due to being tested vs unsafe due to being rushed.\nThe two frames X and Y should essentially paraphrase each other, sharing the same problem and cause but from opposing perspectives.\n4. No relationship: There are no relationships between the new framing and any of the provided framings.\nYour first step for each framing is\n(a) Reason about if the framing holds one of the above relationships with any of the provided framings.\nMultiple relationships could be true, but prioritize in the order provided: If a paraphrase relationship holds, it must be provided.\nIf there is no paraphrase, then look for specialize. If there is a specialize relationship, provide it, otherwise look for contradicts.\nFinally, if there is no contradicts relationship, answer no relationship.\nIf a relationship is identified, then\n(b) State that relationship, using the IDs for each framing."}
